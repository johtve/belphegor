# belphegor
Browser userscript aiming to make UiO IFI's Devilry less visually confusing.

The name derives from the chief demon of sloth, a sin all programmers are guilty of in some form.

# Features
Belphegor adds custom color coding for Devilry assignments based on their status:
- Waiting for deliveries - yellow
- Handed in, waiting for feedback - light green
- Passed - dark green
- Failed - red


# Installation

1. Install the Tampermonkey extension for your browser (make sure to enable it if it isn't already)
2. Click the **"Raw"** button on the github page of the main JS file
3. Click "Install" and Tampermoneky should handle the rest
